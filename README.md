## üåê Deployment

This project is optimized for any kind of deployment:

### Vercel
- Push to GitHub
- Import into Vercel
- Add your environment variable DATABASE_URL
- Deploy and enjoy!

### Docker (VPS Hosting recomended)
- Push to GitHub
- Import into your VPS hosting
- Add your environment variable DATABASE_URL
- Deploy with docker-compose command and enjoy!
> Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml is provided for example

### Docker on VPS Tips

#### Database Bug
After you run the compose (specially detached mode) and the database is not attached, I get you some tips:
```bash
sudo docker exec -it web_container_name sh
```
> Check your web container name in docker compose, or run this:
```bash
docker ps
```
Inside container
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
These will connect your web app to your database hosting (if you use online database hosting).

#### Run with Other Projects

If you running this along with other projects (or services that using the same port), you can edit the traefik config in docker-compose.yml to avoid conflicts:

```bash
  traefik: #for proxy
    image: traefik:v2.11
    container_name: traefik
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:8080"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:8443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpchallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=any@gmail.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
      - "--log.level=DEBUG"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"   # plain HTTP
      - "8443:8443"   # TLS
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "./traefik:/letsencrypt"
```
Then you can use <strong>reverse proxy</strong> and <strong>cerbot SSL</strong> to make it secure and reliable. Nginx example:
```bash
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://localhost:8443;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_ssl_verify off;  # because Traefik uses self-signed or ACME TLS
    }

}

server {
    if ($host = your_domain.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```
> just like I did :)
